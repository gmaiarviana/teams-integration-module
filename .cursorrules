- ‚ùå **NEVER** create README, summary files, or progress reports proactively
- ‚ùå **NEVER** assume the user wants additional files
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS ASK** before creating any new file
- ‚úÖ **ONLY** implement exactly what is requested
- ‚úÖ **ASK** for clarification if ambiguous

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS

- Test and validate changes work as expected
- Provide brief technical summary of what was done
- **DO NOT** create extra documentation to "help"

## üíª ENVIRONMENT

- Use `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of `curl`
- Follow PowerShell syntax conventions

## ‚ú® CODE QUALITY

- Write clean, maintainable code
